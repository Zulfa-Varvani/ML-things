Using dataset from CIFAR-10
![cifar10 image](https://github.com/Zulfa-Varvani/ML-things/blob/main/image%20classification/cifar10.png)

* Used Keras
* CNN for classification
* 50000 images for training and 1000 images for testing
* Accuracy of about 70%

### Future improvements:
* Improve accuracy
* Work more on pre-processing
* Play around with neural net for better prediction
